# How can using three dimensional convolution neural networks help speed up topology optimization?
Topology optimization seeks to calculate the ideal structure to support a given set of boundary and loading conditions within a given design domain. Following iterations of FEA and optimization, the results are presenting as element density probablilities. This iterative optimization process is computationally intensive, requiring large amounts of computing resources and time. The research team aims to try to speed up this portion of topology optmization by implementing a three dimensional convulation neural network to predict the final result after only a few optimization iterations.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/znt5009/TopOppNN.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/znt5009/TopOppNN.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
